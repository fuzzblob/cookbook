# Baked Yam / Pumpkin

This also works with sweet popatoes and pumpking.

- Preheat oven to 225°C

- Scrub the Yams clean with some water

- Yams onto a baking sheet covered with baking paper

- Bake for 30-40 minutes until soft

For pumpkings instead of cleaning the outside do the following:

- cut the pumpking inhalf

- use a spoon to clean out the center

- bake the pumpking
  
  - [optional] seperate the seeds and bake them too. They are a fun snack!
